# this is a collection of data structures and algorithms.

#### **Data Structures**:
- Hash Table
- Binary Search Tree - The reason its a binary tree simply meads that all elements with in the binary tree only has two nodes attached to them. Binary simply means two.
- Doubly Linked List - This isa linear data structure. all the elements with in a doubly linked list are connected to the next element and they are also linked to the previous elememt, Theere is two exception to this rule. The first one is that the head does not have a previous node and the tail has no next element.
