# This is documentation for the hash table data structure

#### What is a hash table?
In computing, a hash table (hash map;) is a datastructure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a data structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function  to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, form which the desired value can be found.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, bust most hash table designs employ imperfect hash functions, which might caus collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions must be accommodendated in some way.
